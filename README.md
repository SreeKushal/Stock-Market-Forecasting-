# Stock Market Forecasting 

A machine learning project to predict stock prices using historical data. Covers **data preprocessing**, **feature engineering**, **model building**, and **visualization**.

## Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Steps
- Load and clean stock market data
- Engineer technical indicators and features
- Train regression models to predict prices
- Visualize model predictions vs actual prices

## Results
Built a basic predictive model to capture short-term stock price movements and trends.

## Future Improvements 
- Add advanced models (LSTM, XGBoost) for better accuracy
- Integrate live stock market APIs for real-time predictions
- Optimize models using hyperparameter tuning
- Build an interactive dashboard (Streamlit/Flask)
- Include macroeconomic & sentiment-based features
